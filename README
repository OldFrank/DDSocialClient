DDSocialNetworkClient is a handy library that makes access to social networking clients easy!

At the moment, it supports Facebook, Twitter and Flickr.
I am planning to add support for Last.fm, LinkedIn and Foursqure.

The authentication is based on OAuth.

Most of the server communication is done with the *excellent* ASIHTTPRequest library from Ben Copsey!
